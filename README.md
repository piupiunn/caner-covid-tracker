Build With;

+React, +Chartjs, +Leaflet, +Material UI


Description;


I combined the country location and covid information provided by "Disase" with the "Circle" feature provided by "Leaflet", which is used to indicate location on the map. I added the location information I got from "Disesa" to "Leaflet" and specified the locations of the countries. Then I multiplied the area of ​​these location rings with the covid information of the countries I got from "Disesa". As a result, I got rings that get bigger and smaller depending on the location of the countries and the number and type of cases. As a graph, I combined the "Graphjs" library with the data from "Disease" to create a daily chart. I used "Material UI" for the overall application.
